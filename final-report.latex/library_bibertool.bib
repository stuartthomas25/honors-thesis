  ABSTRACT = {It has been conjectured that the mass spectrum of the O(3) non-linear sigma model with a theta term in 2 dimensions may possess an excited state, which decays when theta is lowered from pi below a critical value. Since the direct numerical investigation of the model is prevented by a sign problem, we try to infer some information on the mass spectrum at real theta by studying the model at imaginary theta via analytic continuation. A modified Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm has been introduced to simulate the model with the theta term.},

  ABSTRACT = {We study the gradient flow equation for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions at large N . We parameterize solution of the field at flow time t in powers of bare fields by introducing the coefficient function Xn for the n-th power term (n = 1, 3, {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} ). Reducing the flow equation by keeping only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of equations for Xn's, which can be solved iteratively starting from n = 1. For n = 1 case, we find an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this solution, we show that the two point function at finite flow time t is finite. As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling defined from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n = 3 case.},

Our method is based on numerical simulations at imaginary values of theta, and on scaling transformations that allow a controlled analytic continuation to real values of theta.

  ABSTRACT = {We investigate the cutoff effects in 2-d lattice O(N) models for a variety of lattice actions, and we identify a class of very simple actions for which the lattice artifacts are extremely small. One action agrees with the standard action, except that it constrains neighboring spins to a maximal relative angle delta. We fix delta by demanding that a particular value of the step scaling function agrees with its continuum result already on a rather coarse lattice. Remarkably, the cutoff effects of the entire step scaling function are then reduced to the per mille level. This also applies to the theta-vacuum effects of the step scaling function in the 2-d O(3) model. The cutoff effects of other physical observables including the renormalized coupling and the mass in the isotensor channel are also reduced drastically. Another choice, the mixed action, which combines the standard quadratic with an appropriately tuned large quartic term, also has extremely small cutoff effects. The size of cutoff effects is also investigated analytically in 1-d and at N = infinity in 2-d.},

  ABSTRACT = {We consider lattice field theories with topological actions, which are invariant against small deformations of the fields. Some of these actions have infinite barriers separating different topological sectors. Topological actions do not have the correct classical continuum limit and they cannot be treated using perturbation theory, but they still yield the correct quantum continuum limit. To show this, we present analytic studies of the 1-d O(2) and O(3) model, as well as Monte Carlo simulations of the 2-d O(3) model using topological lattice actions. Some topological actions obey and others violate a lattice Schwarz inequality between the action and the topological charge Q. Irrespective of this, in the 2-d O(3) model the topological susceptibility {$\chi$}t = Q2 /V is logarithmically divergent in the continuum limit. Still, at non-zero distance the correlator of the topological charge density has a finite continuum limit which is consistent with analytic predictions. Our study shows explicitly that some classically important features of an action are irrelevant for reaching the correct quantum continuum limit.},

  ABSTRACT = {The distribution functionPL(s) of the local order parameters in finite blocks of linear dimensionL is studied for Ising lattices of dimensionalityd=2, 3 and 4. Apart from the case where the block is a subsystem of an infinite lattice, also the distribution in finite systems with free [PL(f)(s)] and periodic [PL(p)(s)] boundary conditions is treated. Above the critical pointTc, these distributions tend for largeL towards the same gaussian distribution centered around zero block magnetization, while belowTcthese distributions tend towards two gaussians centered at {$\pm$}M, whereM is the spontaneous magnetization appearing in the infinite systems. However, belowTcthe wings of the distribution at small |s| are distinctly nongaussian, reflecting two-phase coexistence. Hence the distribution functions can be used to obtain the interface tension between ordered phases.},

The lattice expression of {$\chi$}tfLull looks like the formal continuum one, in the sense that no power divergent subtractions are needed for its proper definition. As a consequence, the small mass behaviour of {$\chi$}tfLull leads directly to a multiplicative renormalizable definition of the chiral condensate that does not require any power divergent subtraction.},

  ABSTRACT = {The paper presents a short review of our knowledge today on vacuum condensates in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The condensates are defined as vacuum averages of the operators which arise due to nonperturbative effects. The important role of condensates in determining physical properties of hadrons and of their low-energy interactions in QCD is underlined. The special value of the quark condensate, connected to the existence of baryon masses, is mentioned. Vacuum condensates induced by external fields are discussed. QCD at low energy is checked on the basis of the data on hadronic {$\tau$} decay. In theoretical analysis, the terms of perturbation theory (PT) up to {$\alpha$}3s are accounted for; in the operator product expansion (OPE), those up to dimension 8. The total probability of the decay {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} hadrons (with zero strangeness) and of the {$\tau$} -decay structure functions are best described at {$\alpha$}s(m2{$\tau$} ) = 0.330 {$\pm$} 0.025. It is shown that the Borel sum rules for {$\tau$} -decay structure functions along the rays in the q2-complex plane are in agreement with experiment, having an accuracy of {$\sim$}2\% at the values of the Borel parameter |M 2| {$>$} 0.8 GeV2. The magnitudes of dimension 6 and 8 condensates were found, and the limitations on gluon condensates were obtained. The sum rules for the charmed-quark vector-current polarization operator were analyzed in three loops (i.e., in order {$\alpha$}2s). The value of the charmed-quark mass (in an M S regularization scheme) was found to be mc(m2c) = 1.275 {$\pm$} 0.015 GeV, and the value of gluon condensate was estimated as 0|({$\alpha$}s/{$\pi$})G2|0 = 0.009 {$\pm$} 0.007 GeV4. The general conclusion is that the QCD described by PT + OPE is in good agreement with experiment at Q2 1 GeV2. c 2003 MAIK ``Nauka/Interperiodica''.},

  ABSTRACT = {Theoretical and numerical studies of the Wilson flow in lattice QCD suggest that the gauge field obtained at flow time t{$>$}0 is a smooth renormalized field. The expectation values of local gauge-invariant expressions in this field are thus well-defined physical quantities that probe the theory at length scales on the order of sqrt(t). Moreover, by transforming the QCD functional integral to an integral over the gauge field at a specified flow time, the emergence of the topological (instanton) sectors in the continuum limit becomes transparent and is seen to be caused by a dynamical effect that rapidly separates the sectors when the lattice spacing is reduced from 0.1 fm to smaller values.},

  ABSTRACT = {In the last few years, the Yang–Mills gradient flow was shown to be an attractive tool for non-perturbative studies of non-Abelian gauge theories. Here a simple extension of the flow to the quark fields in QCD is considered. As in the case of the pure-gauge gradient flow, the renormalizability of correlation functions involving local fields at positive flow times can be established using a representation through a local field theory in 4 + 1 dimensions. Applications of the extended flow in lattice QCD include non-perturbative renormalization and O(a) improvement as well as accurate calculations of the chiral condensate and of the pseudo-scalar decay constant in the chiral limit.},

  ABSTRACT = {It is known that the gauge field and its composite operators evolved by the Yang--Mills gradient flow are ultraviolet (UV) finite without any multiplicative wave function renormalization. In this paper, we prove that the gradient flow in the 2D \$O(N)\$ non-linear sigma model possesses a similar property: The flowed \$N\$-vector field and its composite operators are UV finite without multiplicative wave function renormalization. Our proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a \$(2+1)\$-dimensional field theoretical representation of the gradient flow, which possesses local gauge invariance without gauge field. As application of the UV finiteness of the gradient flow, we construct the energy--momentum tensor in the lattice formulation of the \$O(N)\$ non-linear sigma model that automatically restores the correct normalization and the conservation law in the continuum limit.},

  ABSTRACT = {We study the impact of the Gradient Flow on the topology in various models of lattice field theory. The topological susceptibility \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\$ is measured directly, and by the slab method, which is based on the topological content of sub-volumes ("slabs") and estimates \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\$ even when the system remains trapped in a fixed topological sector. The results obtained by both methods are essentially consistent, but the impact of the Gradient Flow on the characteristic quantity of the slab method seems to be different in 2-flavour QCD and in the 2d O(3) model. In the latter model, we further address the question whether or not the Gradient Flow leads to a finite continuum limit of the topological susceptibility (rescaled by the correlation length squared, \$\textbackslash xi\^\{2\}\$). This ongoing study is based on direct measurements of \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\$ in \$L \textbackslash times L\$ lattices, at \$L/\textbackslash xi \textbackslash simeq 6\$.},

  ABSTRACT = {This series of six lectures is an introduction to using the Monte Carlo method to carry out nonperturbative studies in quantum field theories. Path integrals in quantum field theory are reviewed, and their evaluation by the Monte Carlo method with Markov-chain based importance sampling is presented. Properties of Markov chains are discussed in detail and several proofs are presented, culminating in the fundamental limit theorem for irreducible Markov chains. The example of a real scalar field theory is used to illustrate the Metropolis-Hastings method and to demonstrate the effectiveness of an action-preserving (microcanonical) local updating algorithm in reducing autocorrelations. The goal of these lectures is to provide the beginner with the basic skills needed to start carrying out Monte Carlo studies in quantum field theories, as well as to present the underlying theoretical foundations of the method.},

  ABSTRACT = {We explain in detail how to estimate mean values and assess statistical errors for arbitrary functions of elementary observables in Monte Carlo simulations. The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.},
