  abstract = {It has been conjectured that the mass spectrum of the O(3) non-linear sigma model with a theta term in 2 dimensions may possess an excited state, which decays when theta is lowered from pi below a critical value. Since the direct numerical investigation of the model is prevented by a sign problem, we try to infer some information on the mass spectrum at real theta by studying the model at imaginary theta via analytic continuation. A modified Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm has been introduced to simulate the model with the theta term.},

We parameterize solution of the field at flow time t in powers of bare fields by introducing the coefficient function Xn for the n-th power term (n = 1, 3, {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} {$\cdot$} ). Reducing the flow equation by keeping only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of equations for Xn's, which can be solved iteratively starting from n = 1. For n = 1 case, we find an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this solution, we show that the two point function at finite flow time t is finite. As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling defined from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n = 3 case.},

One action agrees with the standard action, except that it constrains neighboring spins to a maximal relative angle delta. We fix delta by demanding that a particular value of the step scaling function agrees with its continuum result already on a rather coarse lattice. Remarkably, the cutoff effects of the entire step scaling function are then reduced to the per mille level. This also applies to the theta-vacuum effects of the step scaling function in the 2-d O(3) model. The cutoff effects of other physical observables including the renormalized coupling and the mass in the isotensor channel are also reduced drastically. Another choice, the mixed action, which combines the standard quadratic with an appropriately tuned large quartic term, also has extremely small cutoff effects. The size of cutoff effects is also investigated analytically in 1-d and at N = infinity in 2-d.},

With the latter it shares --- among other basic aspects --- the property that the continuum functional integral splits into topological sectors. Topology can also be defined in its lattice regularised version, but semi-classical arguments suggest that the topological susceptibility \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\$ does not scale towards a finite continuum limit. Previous numerical studies confirmed that the quantity \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\textbackslash, \textbackslash xi\^\{2\}\$ diverges at large correlation length \$\textbackslash xi\$. Here we investigate the question whether or not this divergence persists when the configurations are smoothened by the Gradient Flow (GF). The GF destroys part of the topological windings; on fine lattices this strongly reduces \$\textbackslash chi\_\{\textbackslash rm t\}\$. However, even when the flow time is so long that the GF impact range --- or smoothing radius --- attains \$\textbackslash xi/2\$, we do still not observe evidence of continuum scaling.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a short review of our knowledge today on vacuum condensates in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The condensates are defined as vacuum averages of the operators which arise due to nonperturbative effects. The important role of condensates in determining physical properties of hadrons and of their low-energy interactions in QCD is underlined. The special value of the quark condensate, connected to the existence of baryon masses, is mentioned. Vacuum condensates induced by external fields are discussed. QCD at low energy is checked on the basis of the data on hadronic {$\tau$} decay. In theoretical analysis, the terms of perturbation theory (PT) up to {$\alpha$}3s are accounted for; in the operator product expansion (OPE), those up to dimension 8. The total probability of the decay {$\tau$} \textrightarrow{} hadrons (with zero strangeness) and of the {$\tau$} -decay structure functions are best described at {$\alpha$}s(m2{$\tau$} ) = 0.330 {$\pm$} 0.025. It is shown that the Borel sum rules for {$\tau$} -decay structure functions along the rays in the q2-complex plane are in agreement with experiment, having an accuracy of {$\sim$}2\% at the values of the Borel parameter |M 2| {$>$} 0.8 GeV2. The magnitudes of dimension 6 and 8 condensates were found, and the limitations on gluon condensates were obtained. The sum rules for the charmed-quark vector-current polarization operator were analyzed in three loops (i.e., in order {$\alpha$}2s). The value of the charmed-quark mass (in an M S regularization scheme) was found to be mc(m2c) = 1.275 {$\pm$} 0.015 GeV, and the value of gluon condensate was estimated as 0|({$\alpha$}s/{$\pi$})G2|0 = 0.009 {$\pm$} 0.007 GeV4. The general conclusion is that the QCD described by PT + OPE is in good agreement with experiment at Q2 1 GeV2. c 2003 MAIK ``Nauka/Interperiodica''.},

  author = {Morningstar, Colin},
  year = {2007},
  month = feb,
  abstract = {This series of six lectures is an introduction to using the Monte Carlo method to carry out nonperturbative studies in quantum field theories. Path integrals in quantum field theory are reviewed, and their evaluation by the Monte Carlo method with Markov-chain based importance sampling is presented. Properties of Markov chains are discussed in detail and several proofs are presented, culminating in the fundamental limit theorem for irreducible Markov chains. The example of a real scalar field theory is used to illustrate the Metropolis-Hastings method and to demonstrate the effectiveness of an action-preserving (microcanonical) local updating algorithm in reducing autocorrelations. The goal of these lectures is to provide the beginner with the basic skills needed to start carrying out Monte Carlo studies in quantum field theories, as well as to present the underlying theoretical foundations of the method.},

  abstract = {We systematically compare three filtering methods used to extract topological excitations from lattice gauge configurations, namely smearing, Laplace filtering and the filtered fermionic topological charge (with chirally improved fermions). Each of these techniques introduces ambiguities, like its parameter dependence. We show, however, that all these methods can be tuned to each other over a broad range of filtering levels and that they reveal very similar topological structures. For these common structures we find an interesting power-law relating the number and packing fraction of clusters of filtered topological charge.},

The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.},
