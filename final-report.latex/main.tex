% Modified by S. Aubin for the class of 2019 Physics theses

%
% This is a LaTeX template for an undergraduate honors or
%   senior thesis in physics at William & Mary. Created from
%   several theses from previous students of D.S. Armstrong,
%   pared down to bare bones.
%
%   you will need this present file (thesis_template.tex)
%   as well as the file  figure1.eps  to make the whole thing
%   (the latter is just an encapsulated postscript figure)
%     For simplicity, we don't use bibtex here; experts can choose
%   to use that more powerful way of dealing with citations.
%
%   To compile it, do:
% > pdflatex thesis_template.tex
% > pdflatex thesis_template.tex  (yes, you need to do it twice to
%                                  fill in the list of tables, figures
%                                  and references).

\paragraph
\indent I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Christopher Monahan. His constant helpfulness has made this research possible and enjoyable. I would also like to thank the entire faculty of the William \& Mary Physics Department. The amount of knowledge and wisdom they have given me has been beyond my imagination.

I would like to acknowledge the help of the High Performance Computing group at William \& Mary, whose cluster performed many of these simulations. I also want to acknowledge the financial help of the 1693 Scholars Program which funded preliminary research over the summer.

Finally, I would like to thank my friends and family who helped me reach this point in my academic and personal journey.

\paragraph
\indent Quantum field theory is an extraordinarily successful framework that describes phenomena in particle physics and condensed matter. The $O(3)$ non-linear sigma model (NLSM) is a specific theory used in both of these fields, describing ferromagnets and acting as a prototype for the strong nuclear force. It features topologically stable configurations known as instantons which cannot continuously evolve to the ground state. The topological susceptibility is a parameter that describes this stability and is predicted to vanish in physical theories, however numerical simulations find that the topological susceptibility diverges in the continuum limit \cite{berg1981}. This issue has motivated the application of the ``gradient flow'', a smoothing of high-frequency modes. We study the effect of the gradient flow on this divergence, finding that it persists as a logarithmic divergence. This result supports a previous study \cite{bietenholz2018} and indicates that either the definition of topological charge is problematic or the NLSM has no well-defined continuum limit. We also study the nontrivial field theory by introducing a $\theta$-term into the action and analyze the topological charge as a function of $\theta$ under the gradient flow.
