    It has been conjectured that the mass spectrum of the O(3) non-linear sigma
    model with a theta term in 2 dimensions may possess an excited state, which
    decays when theta is lowered from pi below a critical value. Since the
    direct numerical investigation of the model is prevented by a sign problem,
    we try to infer some information on the mass spectrum at real theta by
    studying the model at imaginary theta via analytic continuation. A modified
    Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm has been introduced to simulate the model
    with the theta term.

    We study the gradient ﬂow equation for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in two
    dimensions at large N . We parameterize solution of the ﬁeld at ﬂow time t
    in powers of bare ﬁelds by introducing the coeﬃcient function Xn for the
    n-th power term (n = 1, 3, · · · ). Reducing the ﬂow equation by keeping
    only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of
    equations for Xn’s, which can be solved iteratively starting from n = 1. For
    n = 1 case, we ﬁnd an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this
    solution, we show that the two point function at ﬁnite ﬂow time t is ﬁnite.
    As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling deﬁned
    from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n = 3 case.

    We investigate the cutoff effects in 2-d lattice O(N) models for a variety
    of lattice actions, and we identify a class of very simple actions for which
    the lattice artifacts are extremely small. One action agrees with the
    standard action, except that it constrains neighboring spins to a maximal
    relative angle delta. We fix delta by demanding that a particular value of
    the step scaling function agrees with its continuum result already on a
    rather coarse lattice. Remarkably, the cutoff effects of the entire step
    scaling function are then reduced to the per mille level. This also applies
    to the theta-vacuum effects of the step scaling function in the 2-d O(3)
    model. The cutoff effects of other physical observables including the
    renormalized coupling and the mass in the isotensor channel are also reduced
    drastically. Another choice, the mixed action, which combines the standard
    quadratic with an appropriately tuned large quartic term, also has extremely
    small cutoff effects. The size of cutoff effects is also investigated
    analytically in 1-d and at N = infinity in 2-d.

    It is known that the gauge field and its composite operators evolved by the
    Yang--Mills gradient flow are ultraviolet (UV) finite without any
    multiplicative wave function renormalization. In this paper, we prove that
    the gradient flow in the 2D $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model possesses a
    similar property: The flowed $N$-vector field and its composite operators
    are UV finite without multiplicative wave function renormalization. Our
    proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a $(2+1)$-dimensional field
    theoretical representation of the gradient flow, which possesses local gauge
    invariance without gauge field. As application of the UV finiteness of the
    gradient flow, we construct the energy--momentum tensor in the lattice
    formulation of the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model that automatically restores
    the correct normalization and the conservation law in the continuum limit.

    This series of six lectures is an introduction to using the Monte Carlo
    method to carry out nonperturbative studies in quantum field theories. Path
    integrals in quantum field theory are reviewed, and their evaluation by the
    Monte Carlo method with Markov-chain based importance sampling is presented.
    Properties of Markov chains are discussed in detail and several proofs are
    presented, culminating in the fundamental limit theorem for irreducible
    Markov chains. The example of a real scalar field theory is used to
    illustrate the Metropolis-Hastings method and to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of an action-preserving (microcanonical) local updating
    algorithm in reducing autocorrelations. The goal of these lectures is to
    provide the beginner with the basic skills needed to start carrying out
    Monte Carlo studies in quantum field theories, as well as to present the
    underlying theoretical foundations of the method.

    We explain in detail how to estimate mean values and assess statistical
    errors for arbitrary functions of elementary observables in Monte Carlo
    simulations. The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation
    functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than
    binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of
    expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is
    computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation
    algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is
    offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine
    independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.
