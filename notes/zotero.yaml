    We study the gradient ﬂow equation for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in two
    dimensions at large N . We parameterize solution of the ﬁeld at ﬂow time t
    in powers of bare ﬁelds by introducing the coeﬃcient function Xn for the
    n-th power term (n = 1, 3, · · · ). Reducing the ﬂow equation by keeping
    only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of
    equations for Xn’s, which can be solved iteratively starting from n = 1. For
    n = 1 case, we ﬁnd an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this
    solution, we show that the two point function at ﬁnite ﬂow time t is ﬁnite.
    As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling deﬁned
    from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n = 3 case.

    It is known that the gauge field and its composite operators evolved by the
    Yang--Mills gradient flow are ultraviolet (UV) finite without any
    multiplicative wave function renormalization. In this paper, we prove that
    the gradient flow in the 2D $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model possesses a
    similar property: The flowed $N$-vector field and its composite operators
    are UV finite without multiplicative wave function renormalization. Our
    proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a $(2+1)$-dimensional field
    theoretical representation of the gradient flow, which possesses local gauge
    invariance without gauge field. As application of the UV finiteness of the
    gradient flow, we construct the energy--momentum tensor in the lattice
    formulation of the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model that automatically restores
    the correct normalization and the conservation law in the continuum limit.
