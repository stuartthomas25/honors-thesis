    It has been conjectured that the mass spectrum of the O(3) non-linear sigma
    model with a theta term in 2 dimensions may possess an excited state, which
    decays when theta is lowered from pi below a critical value. Since the
    direct numerical investigation of the model is prevented by a sign problem,
    we try to infer some information on the mass spectrum at real theta by
    studying the model at imaginary theta via analytic continuation. A modified
    Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm has been introduced to simulate the model
    with the theta term.

    We study the gradient ﬂow equation for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in two
    dimensions at large N . We parameterize solution of the ﬁeld at ﬂow time t
    in powers of bare ﬁelds by introducing the coeﬃcient function Xn for the
    n-th power term (n = 1, 3, · · · ). Reducing the ﬂow equation by keeping
    only the contributions at leading order in large N , we obtain a set of
    equations for Xn’s, which can be solved iteratively starting from n = 1. For
    n = 1 case, we ﬁnd an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this
    solution, we show that the two point function at ﬁnite ﬂow time t is ﬁnite.
    As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling deﬁned
    from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n = 3 case.

    We investigate the critical behaviour at theta=pi of the two-dimensional
    O(3) nonlinear sigma model with topological term on the lattice. Our method
    is based on numerical simulations at imaginary values of theta, and on
    scaling transformations that allow a controlled analytic continuation to
    real values of theta. Our results are compatible with a second order phase
    transition, with the critical exponent of the SU(2)_1
    Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten model, for sufficiently small values of the
    coupling.

    We investigate the cutoff effects in 2-d lattice O(N) models for a variety
    of lattice actions, and we identify a class of very simple actions for which
    the lattice artifacts are extremely small. One action agrees with the
    standard action, except that it constrains neighboring spins to a maximal
    relative angle delta. We fix delta by demanding that a particular value of
    the step scaling function agrees with its continuum result already on a
    rather coarse lattice. Remarkably, the cutoff effects of the entire step
    scaling function are then reduced to the per mille level. This also applies
    to the theta-vacuum effects of the step scaling function in the 2-d O(3)
    model. The cutoff effects of other physical observables including the
    renormalized coupling and the mass in the isotensor channel are also reduced
    drastically. Another choice, the mixed action, which combines the standard
    quadratic with an appropriately tuned large quartic term, also has extremely
    small cutoff effects. The size of cutoff effects is also investigated
    analytically in 1-d and at N = infinity in 2-d.

    The 2d O(3) model is widely used as a toy model for ferromagnetism and for
    Quantum Chromodynamics. With the latter it shares --- among other basic
    aspects --- the property that the continuum functional integral splits into
    topological sectors. Topology can also be defined in its lattice regularised
    version, but semi-classical arguments suggest that the topological
    susceptibility $\chi_{\rm t}$ does not scale towards a finite continuum
    limit. Previous numerical studies confirmed that the quantity $\chi_{\rm
    t}\, \xi^{2}$ diverges at large correlation length $\xi$. Here we
    investigate the question whether or not this divergence persists when the
    configurations are smoothened by the Gradient Flow (GF). The GF destroys
    part of the topological windings; on fine lattices this strongly reduces
    $\chi_{\rm t}$. However, even when the flow time is so long that the GF
    impact range --- or smoothing radius --- attains $\xi/2$, we do still not
    observe evidence of continuum scaling.

    We compute the topological susceptibility for the SU(3) Yang--Mills theory
    by employing the expression of the topological charge density operator
    suggested by Neuberger's fermions. In the continuum limit we find r_0^4 chi
    = 0.059(3), which corresponds to chi=(191 +/- 5 MeV)^4 if F_K is used to set
    the scale. Our result supports the Witten--Veneziano explanation for the
    large mass of the eta'.

    The paper presents a short review of our knowledge today on vacuum
    condensates in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The condensates are deﬁned as
    vacuum averages of the operators which arise due to nonperturbative eﬀects.
    The important role of condensates in determining physical properties of
    hadrons and of their low-energy interactions in QCD is underlined. The
    special value of the quark condensate, connected to the existence of baryon
    masses, is mentioned. Vacuum condensates induced by external ﬁelds are
    discussed. QCD at low energy is checked on the basis of the data on hadronic
    τ decay. In theoretical analysis, the terms of perturbation theory (PT) up
    to α3s are accounted for; in the operator product expansion (OPE), those up
    to dimension 8. The total probability of the decay τ → hadrons (with zero
    strangeness) and of the τ -decay structure functions are best described at
    αs(m2τ ) = 0.330 ± 0.025. It is shown that the Borel sum rules for τ -decay
    structure functions along the rays in the q2-complex plane are in agreement
    with experiment, having an accuracy of ∼2% at the values of the Borel
    parameter |M 2| > 0.8 GeV2. The magnitudes of dimension 6 and 8 condensates
    were found, and the limitations on gluon condensates were obtained. The sum
    rules for the charmed-quark vector-current polarization operator were
    analyzed in three loops (i.e., in order α2s). The value of the charmed-quark
    mass (in an M S regularization scheme) was found to be mc(m2c) = 1.275 ±
    0.015 GeV, and the value of gluon condensate was estimated as 0|(αs/π)G2|0 =
    0.009 ± 0.007 GeV4. The general conclusion is that the QCD described by PT +
    OPE is in good agreement with experiment at Q2 1 GeV2. c 2003 MAIK

    It is known that the gauge field and its composite operators evolved by the
    Yang--Mills gradient flow are ultraviolet (UV) finite without any
    multiplicative wave function renormalization. In this paper, we prove that
    the gradient flow in the 2D $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model possesses a
    similar property: The flowed $N$-vector field and its composite operators
    are UV finite without multiplicative wave function renormalization. Our
    proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a $(2+1)$-dimensional field
    theoretical representation of the gradient flow, which possesses local gauge
    invariance without gauge field. As application of the UV finiteness of the
    gradient flow, we construct the energy--momentum tensor in the lattice
    formulation of the $O(N)$ non-linear sigma model that automatically restores
    the correct normalization and the conservation law in the continuum limit.

    We study the impact of the Gradient Flow on the topology in various models
    of lattice field theory. The topological susceptibility $\chi_{\rm t}$ is
    measured directly, and by the slab method, which is based on the topological
    content of sub-volumes ("slabs") and estimates $\chi_{\rm t}$ even when the
    system remains trapped in a fixed topological sector. The results obtained
    by both methods are essentially consistent, but the impact of the Gradient
    Flow on the characteristic quantity of the slab method seems to be different
    in 2-flavour QCD and in the 2d O(3) model. In the latter model, we further
    address the question whether or not the Gradient Flow leads to a finite
    continuum limit of the topological susceptibility (rescaled by the
    correlation length squared, $\xi^{2}$). This ongoing study is based on
    direct measurements of $\chi_{\rm t}$ in $L \times L$ lattices, at $L/\xi
    \simeq 6$.

    This series of six lectures is an introduction to using the Monte Carlo
    method to carry out nonperturbative studies in quantum field theories. Path
    integrals in quantum field theory are reviewed, and their evaluation by the
    Monte Carlo method with Markov-chain based importance sampling is presented.
    Properties of Markov chains are discussed in detail and several proofs are
    presented, culminating in the fundamental limit theorem for irreducible
    Markov chains. The example of a real scalar field theory is used to
    illustrate the Metropolis-Hastings method and to demonstrate the
    effectiveness of an action-preserving (microcanonical) local updating
    algorithm in reducing autocorrelations. The goal of these lectures is to
    provide the beginner with the basic skills needed to start carrying out
    Monte Carlo studies in quantum field theories, as well as to present the
    underlying theoretical foundations of the method.

    We systematically compare three filtering methods used to extract
    topological excitations from lattice gauge configurations, namely smearing,
    Laplace filtering and the filtered fermionic topological charge (with
    chirally improved fermions). Each of these techniques introduces
    ambiguities, like its parameter dependence. We show, however, that all these
    methods can be tuned to each other over a broad range of filtering levels
    and that they reveal very similar topological structures. For these common
    structures we find an interesting power-law relating the number and packing
    fraction of clusters of filtered topological charge.

    We explain in detail how to estimate mean values and assess statistical
    errors for arbitrary functions of elementary observables in Monte Carlo
    simulations. The method is to estimate and sum the relevant autocorrelation
    functions, which is argued to produce more certain error estimates than
    binning techniques and hence to help toward a better exploitation of
    expensive simulations. An effective integrated autocorrelation time is
    computed which is suitable to benchmark efficiencies of simulation
    algorithms with regard to specific observables of interest. A Matlab code is
    offered for download that implements the method. It can also combine
    independent runs (replica) allowing to judge their consistency.
