- Problem: After converting to Cython, observables do not indicate a phase transition at the expected value.
- I run the a Markov chain with and without the Wolff algorithm at $m_0^2=-0.72$. The result depends on the Wolff algorithm, exhibiting the broken phase without the Wolff algorithm but the symmetric phase with the Wolff algorithm. This indicates that there is some bug in the Wolff algorithm.
