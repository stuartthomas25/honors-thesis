abstract = {We study the gradient flow equation for the O(N) nonlinear sigma model in two dimensions at large N. We parameterize solution of the field at flow time t in powers of bare fields by introducing the coefficient function X_n for the n-th power term (n=1,3.). Reducing the flow equation by keeping only the contributions at leading order in large N, we obtain a set of equations for X_n's, which can be solved iteratively starting from n=1. For n=1 case, we find an explicit form of the exact solution. Using this solution, we show that the two point function at finite flow time t is finite. As an application, we obtain the non-perturbative running coupling defined from the energy density. We also discuss the solution for n=3 case.},

abstract = {It is known that the gauge field and its composite operators evolved by the Yang--Mills gradient flow are ultraviolet (UV) finite without any multiplicative wave function renormalization. In this paper, we prove that the gradient flow in the 2D \$O(N)\$ non-linear sigma model possesses a similar property: The flowed \$N\$-vector field and its composite operators are UV finite without multiplicative wave function renormalization. Our proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a \$(2+1)\$-dimensional field theoretical representation of the gradient flow, which possesses local gauge invariance without gauge field. As application of the UV finiteness of the gradient flow, we construct the energy--momentum tensor in the lattice formulation of the \$O(N)\$ non-linear sigma model that automatically restores the correct normalization and the conservation law in the continuum limit.},
